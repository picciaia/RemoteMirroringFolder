# RemoteMirroringFolder
The RemoteMirroringFolder (RMF) uses Microsoft Sync Framework to implement and maintain  a complete-mirrored folder structure on two separated folders (local or remote).
The application detects changes on one folder and replicates these changes and the other directory.
This process can be started either as a standard windows console app or as a windows service.
